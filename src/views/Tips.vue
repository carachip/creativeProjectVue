                        Zacharie and I enjoy each others cooking habits as we both try very hard to follow good practices 
                        and maintain a well-taken care of and clean kitchen.  That being said, we are both learning new things
                        from one another about how that should be done.  Here's a list of some ways to make sure the kitchen
                        stays in best condition!
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Never use the rag you use to clean the counters on the floor</li>
                        <li>Clean rags frequently. Don't be afraid to toss out your old sponge</li>
                        <li>Do not scoop out flour with the measuring cup (or worse, the liquid measuring container), rather, use a spoon</li>
                        <li>Rinse off food from used kitchen appliances immediately after use</li>
                        <li>Clean as you cook</li>
                        <li>Keep stovetop clean of crumbs and oil splatters</li>
                        <li>Avoid using metal on non-stick surfaces</li>
                        <li>Keep the lids of squeeze bottles clean</li>
                        <li>Use placemats and coasters (especially on wood)</li>
                        <li>Wipe off countertops after use</li>
                        <li>Store kitchen appliances in a orderly fashion</li>
                        <li>Keep floors clean</li>
                        <li>Don't be afraid to spend a little more to get something that will last</li>
                    </ul>
